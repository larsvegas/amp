  ---- Hands-on service state management
       for your development environments.

  Synopsis
  --------
  Amp starts, stops, restarts and reloads configured services independent from
  init.d or any other operating system specific service management daemon. Amp
  is "hands-on" in that it lets you directly ("dirtily") add and manipulate
  services and their options without needing to deal with elaborate syntaxes
  of sophisticated service managment systems.
